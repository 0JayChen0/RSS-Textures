Real Solar System Texture pack (DDS Edition) for KSP 1.0+ (RSS-Kopernicus)

NathanKell

This is a texture pack for Real Solar System, which will convert the Kerbol System into the Solar System, rescaling, moving, and changing KSP's planets, moons, etc. to match our own.

Installation:
1. Create an RSS-Textures folder in KSP/GameData
2. Create a PluginData folder inside that
3. Copy all the Biomes into the PluginData folder
4. Copy all the 2048s into the main folder, and all 2048/PluginData files into RSS-Textures/PluginData
5. If you only want 2048 resolution, you're done!
6. Copy all the 4096s into the main folder, and all 4096/PluginData files into RSS-Textures/PluginData and choose Overwrite
7. If you only want 4096 resolution you're done!
8. Copy all the 8192s into the main folder, and all 8192/PluginData files into RSS-Textures/PluginData and choose Overwrite
9. You now have the 8192 texture set and are done!

Supreme thanks to dimonnomid and SpacedInvader for incredible art for RSS. RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions.
